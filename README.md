As we'll be either pulling in parts of [Bootstrap](http://bootstrap.io) or at the very least aiming for that type of project, we're going to use [Less](http://lesscss.org/) which adds variables and other goodies into CSS.

For those new to Less, it's worth checking out [SimpLESS](http://wearekiss.com/simpless) (which runs on all platforms) which watches and compiles Less into CSS.
